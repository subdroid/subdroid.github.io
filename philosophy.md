## The Jigsaw Puzzle Analogy

This is a concept I discussed with my friend, Dr. Bidisha Kantha, many years ago:

We are all **pieces of a huge jigsaw puzzle**, and every piece is broken and deformed. There is no way any two pieces will ever fit together *perfectly*. What truly makes sense is to find a piece that requires **the least amount of pain or force to fit alongside your own**.

## Love: Reversible vs. Irreversible

Consider the difference between **reversible and irreversible change**:

* **Prem** (initial affection/infatuation) is like a **reversible reaction**—it can often revert to its original state.
* **Bhalobasha** (deep, abiding love) is an **irreversible reaction**—once formed, it fundamentally changes you and cannot be undone.
