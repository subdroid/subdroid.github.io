# About

About
I’m an AI Engineer at [ProRata AI](www.prorata.ai), where I work on the Inference Engine that powers [gist.ai](gist.ai)
and Gist Answers. My work focuses on building scalable Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and LLM inference systems that make enterprise knowledge search faster, more accurate, and contextually grounded.

Core focus areas include:
• Optimizing RAG and semantic retrieval architectures to improve search relevance and query understanding.
• Designing strategies for multi-turn grounding, context augmentation, and hallucination mitigation.
• Addressing production constraints around latency, cost, and effective context management.
• Building and deploying resilient, production-grade RESTful inference services.

Previously, I’ve worked on Machine Translation, Natural Language Understanding, Multimodal Learning, and LLM Interpretability.

I’m passionate about bridging deep learning research and real-world deployment, translating modeling advances into measurable user impact at scale.

Always open to conversations about RAG optimization, inference scaling, and LLM productization.
