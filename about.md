# About

I’m a research engineer at ProRata, working on the Inference engine powering gist.ai and Gist Answers. my job involves working on retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems and scalable inference pipelines for large language models. My current focus is on building and optimizing our answer engine, optimizing query understanding and handling multi-turn grounding for context augmentation. I'm also tackling other real-world challenges of deploying LLMs: latency, relevance, hallucination, and context management. I have also experience with designing, implementing and deploying production grade RESTful systems. 

Earlier, I worked on machine translation, natural language understanding, multimodal learning, and LLM interpretability, with a consistent interest in how language and meaning are encoded in deep neural networks. I care deeply about bridging the gap between research insights and production constraints, and I’m especially excited by work that combines core modeling improvements with measurable user impact.
